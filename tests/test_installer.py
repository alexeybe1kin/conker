"""What the installer promises, asserted.

Every rule in issue #32 is written here as a test, because a rule nobody checks
is a rule that decays. These run the real script against real Docker — but only
its read-only verbs (`info`, `compose config`), never `pull` or `up`, so the
suite is fast and changes nothing.

The one thing deliberately not mocked is `docker compose config`. It is the
only check that the compose file and the generated .env actually agree, and a
fake would assert nothing.
