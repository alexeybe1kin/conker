# Architecture

How Conker is shaped. **Why** each choice was made lives in [`adr/`](adr/); this document describes
the system that resulted. Vocabulary is defined in [`../CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md). Build order is
in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).

---

## 1. What Conker is

Conker is a **self-hosted personal AI companion and control plane** for one owner, on one server,
reachable only over a private network.

The premise, from [`concept/the-idea.md`](concept/the-idea.md): AI is a way to reclaim time. Two
things cannot be delegated because they live in the owner physically — **the body** and
**knowledge**. Everything else is overhead, and overhead is automatable.

But "automate everything" is too wide a frame to build on, which is the actual reason for memory:

> **Memory is the record that makes it possible to notice what is repeated, forgotten, or
> automatable.**

So Conker is not a chatbot with a memory feature. It is a loop, and memory is what closes it.

```
what you do and say  →  evidence + memory  →  pattern recognition  →  proposal  →  approval  →  execution
                              ↑                                                                     │
                              └─────────────────── becomes new evidence ────────────────────────────┘
```

Pattern recognition runs **nightly on a schedule** and **live in conversation**. Triggering on every
new memory was considered and rejected on cost.

**Consequence for design:** the screen showing what Conker is *proposing* matters more than the
chat. Chat is how you talk to it; proposals are what it is for.

**Conker is the universal layer and nothing else.** The eight domain products in the idea archive
are not parts of Conker — they are among the things Conker will be asked to build once it works.

## 2. Components

Five services and one dashboard.

| Component | Owns | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Pi** | Agent turns, sessions, jobs and cron, model routing, execution history. The only service the browser talks to. | Planned |
| **MemoryGate** | Evidence → analysis → memory, with lineage. PostgreSQL as source of truth, vector index for semantic search. | Live, semantic retrieval degraded |
| **ToolGate** | Every real-world action: tools, secrets, policy, execution, audit, approvals. | Live, MCP bridge defective |
| **SystemGate** | Read-only machine truth: health, processes, ports, containers, packages, backups, logs. | Live |
| **Embedding service** | Text → vectors. Sidecar, swappable model. | Planned |
| **Dashboard** | The owner's surface. Nine screens. | Planned |

Status uses the eight-state vocabulary from `principles.md` §1. Nothing is `live` because it was
designed. Verified detail: [`research/gate-surfaces.md`](research/gate-surfaces.md).

                        ┌─────┴─────┐
                        │ Dashboard │
                        └─────┬─────┘
                              │  every request, nothing else
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    │   Pi — runtime    │
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
          ┌───────────┬───────┴───────┬─────────────┐
     MemoryGate   ToolGate       SystemGate    what Conker builds
     remembers      acts          observes      (tools, via ToolGate)
          │            │
     Embedding    outside world
```

### The rule that holds it together

**Boundaries do not blur.**

- MemoryGate remembers; it never executes.
- ToolGate acts; it never decides what the owner values.
- SystemGate observes; it is never a shell or an execution path.
- Pi coordinates; it never becomes the database. **No store beyond session state and execution
  history.**

Each is a refusal, and the refusals are what make an always-on system with server access safe to
live with.

### The browser never touches a gate

The dashboard talks only to Pi. This is what keeps `principles.md` §3's forbidden list — provider
keys, admin keys, raw tool arguments, command lines, host paths, container sockets — off the client
structurally rather than by discipline.

The "terminal" surface in the concept notes is a **view** of what SystemGate observed and ToolGate
executed. A real interactive shell in an untrusted client would be a backdoor around the action
boundary and is not built.

---

## 3. How the AI works

Pi runs a deliberately thin turn loop over a provider abstraction. Thin matters: the loop must
behave identically no matter which model answers.

**A turn.** A message arrives. Pi assembles context — recent conversation plus a bounded package
from MemoryGate, never a raw database read. It routes to a model, calls it with the tools ToolGate
currently exposes, executes tool calls back through ToolGate, and appends the result.

**History is append-only.** Current models bind reasoning blocks to the producing model and reject
edited history. Nothing is ever rewritten in place.

**Routing.** A cheap model carries ordinary conversation and escalates on explicit signals — tool
use needed, a failed call needing recovery, analysis rather than conversation, or the owner asking.
Escalation triggers are logged and reviewed, because a cheap model that fails and escalates has cost
both.

**Free by default.** Every free and local model is discovered and configured automatically, so a
fresh install works with no payment and no key. Paid models are the owner's own, added deliberately.
Spend is tracked per turn — model, tokens in and out, cached tokens, cost, latency — precisely
because it is their money.

**Caching before model choice.** Pi's system prompt and tool definitions are stable across turns.
Rendered stable-first, they cache and only the volatile tail is re-billed. Nothing per-request may
leak into that prefix. Lever order: caching → input-token hygiene → effort/model tier → provider.

**When context runs out**, Pi summarises and **forks**: closes the session, writes a summary, opens
a child seeded by it pointing back at the parent. Lineage stays walkable.

**The nightly job** reads new evidence since a watermark, never the corpus, under a hard token
budget. Its output is proposals. It executes nothing.

---

## 4. What Conker may do without asking

Configured by the owner, per action class. See [ADR-0006](adr/0006-autonomy-is-a-configurable-policy.md).

| Class | Default |
|---|---|
| **Observe** — read, analyse, search, draft, propose | Always free. The whole nightly engine lives here. |
| **Prepare** — build, stage, write files that are not executed | Free; can be tightened |
| **Act locally** — run a service, execute a script | Approval required; can be loosened |
| **Act outward** — send, post, spend, external accounts | Approval required; per-capability opt-in with a hard limit |

`principles.md` §10's refusals are never settings. Raising a level changes *whether a class must
ask*, never *how long a yes lasts* — there is no always-allow for an individual action.

---

## 5. Install and first run

**One terminal command.** No web installer. The script checks the machine, asks a few
plain-language questions, generates every secret, writes compose with **pinned image tags**, pulls,
starts, waits for health, and prints one URL.

It never asks for anything it can work out itself, never asks a person to invent a secret, never
reports success for a service it did not reach, and on failure names what broke and the exact next
step. It is idempotent and upgradeable.

**Distribution:** this repository is the umbrella — installer, compose, docs, dashboard, design
system. Every module, **Pi included**, is consumed as a pinned GHCR image from its own repository,
so each stays independently forkable and runnable.

> Pi was originally planned to live inside this repository. It ended up in
> [`alexeybe1kin/pi`](https://github.com/alexeybe1kin/pi) instead, because the moment it had a
> `/health` contract, a changelog and a published image it was a module like any other — and a
> single rule ("every module ships its own image, the umbrella composes them") is easier to hold
> than a rule with one exception in it. The installer treats all five identically as a result.

Two further things the installer settled, both visible in
[`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml):

- **One Ollama, shared.** Pi thinks with it and Embeddings vectorises with it. The gates' own
  compose files each ran their own, which downloads and stores every model twice for no benefit.
- **The compose file is committed, not generated.** The installer writes `.env` and nothing else;
  versions live in [`versions.env`](../versions.env) and resolve into the compose file. Pinning is
  therefore one legible diff rather than a file that only exists after a script has run — and what
  a stranger reads in the repository is exactly what runs.

**Tailscale is offered, never assumed.** Default binds to localhost and the local network. There is
no public-internet path at all, and the docs say why.

**First run:** a designed welcome that asks nothing · your name, then a password explained in plain
words · name and shape your companion (`Conker` is only the default; voice and appearance drop into
this step at later checkpoints) · a short honest summary of service state.

Then a **guided tour**: one element highlighted at a time, explained in a small dialog pointing at
the real thing on the real screen. Replayable from help, skippable at every step, never blocking the
product, running on real screens with real data — anything illustrative is labelled as an example.

---

## 6. Screens

Nine, ordered by how often they are needed.

**The daily loop** — Chat · **Proposals** · Approvals
**Reference** — Memory · Journal
**Control** — Agents · Tools · Jobs · System

Settings and model spend live inside the screens they belong to.

**Proposals is the most important screen in the product.** Each proposal shows what Conker noticed,
the evidence behind it with a path back to the source, what it suggests, and what would happen if
approved. A proposal that cannot answer *"why are you telling me this?"* is not shown.

**Truthful status is a component**, not a convention — one implementation of the eight states, used
everywhere. No green badge from intended configuration. A stale value shows its age. A failed fetch
shows `unknown`, never a stale value silently reused. `empty` and `degraded` look different, because
"nothing yet" and "it failed" are different facts.

One responsive application, not separate desktop and mobile products.

---

## 7. One product, not five

One **design system** — tokens for both themes, layout, components, iconography, the status
vocabulary — defined once and consumed by the only UI. No module defines its own colour or type.

Every module presents identically from outside:

| Ships | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Same sections, same order: what it is · its boundary · run it · configure it · API · status |
| `GET /health` | Identical shape everywhere, so one dashboard renders any module with no special cases |
| `openapi.json` | Generated, never hand-written. This is what a forker swaps against |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Runs standalone for development, composes into the whole for real use |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Honest versioning, so replacing a module has visible consequences |
| Config & errors | One style, one shape, documented precedence |

**Enforced in CI**, including a lint rule failing the build on a raw hex value or font-family in
application code. A convention nobody checks decays.

**Naming carries information.** `-Gate` marks a controlled boundary. Pi passes through them and does
not take the suffix.

## 8. Stack

Python and FastAPI for every service, matching the gates — one backend language, one toolchain.
React for the dashboard. Pi keeps sessions and history in SQLite with WAL; MemoryGate uses
PostgreSQL and a vector index; ToolGate uses SQLite. Docker Compose composes the set. One Ubuntu
server, running 24/7, devices thin.
