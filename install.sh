#
# Conker — one command.
#
# Checks the machine, asks a few plain questions, generates every secret,
# writes .env, pulls pinned images, starts them, waits for health, and prints
# one URL.
#
# Three rules shape everything below:
#
#   It never asks for anything it can work out itself, and never asks a person
#   to invent a secret. Every key here comes from a random generator.
#
#   It never reports success for a service it did not reach. A service that
#   does not answer is reported degraded, with the reason, and the install
#   still finishes with whatever does work.
#
#   Re-running it repairs rather than duplicates. Existing secrets are kept —
#   regenerating them would lock you out of your own data.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                 ask the questions
#   ./install.sh --yes           accept every default, ask nothing
#   ./install.sh --dry-run       do everything except pull and start
#   ./install.sh --check         only check the machine, change nothing
